Welcome to [Mathematics Behind AI](https://aaumar.github.io/Math-Behind-AI/). 

This website aims to share the mathematical background of artificial intelligence. We provide substantial material to grasp the mathematical aspects of several popular algorithms that are mainly used in real-life nowadays. 

Currently, we are focused on sharing the mathematics of supervised learning algorithms. Starting from understanding the optimizers available from established platforms like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) such as Gradient Descent and its advanced technique. 

We introduce the structure of artificial neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm to train the network. In addition, recurrent neural network (RNN), which is known as a good approximation method for a dynamical system, is also presented on this website together with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) as a solution to vanishing gradient in RNN.
